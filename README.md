# candlestix

A daemon that manages always-on, very-long-lived **specialty agents**. It
starts when the machine starts, runs in the background, and keeps blank
agents alive. An operator attaches a terminal to one and tells it what to do
— setting up MCP servers, giving it a role — and the daemon's job is just to
keep that agent alive and restore it correctly across restarts.

candlestix is deliberately **not rigid**. It does not know what roles exist.
The role lives in the conversation an operator has with an agent, not in the
product — there is no director type, no watcher type, no built-in taxonomy
of agent kinds. Whether one agent ends up directing others is a choice an
operator makes in conversation, not something candlestix models.

candlestix is role shaped, not ticket shaped: an agent here is born from a
job description, not a Jira issue, has no query that discovers it, and has
no "Done." That is the whole reason it is a separate product from `butchr`
(which is ticket shaped end to end) rather than a mode of it.

## Status

Foundation stage. This repo currently has a scaffold and a minimal
entrypoint that starts up, logs, stays running, and shuts down cleanly on
`SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` — it does not yet keep any agents alive. The roster and
the supervisor loop that actually make it a daemon are separate, later
stories. The health/heartbeat components described below exist now, but are
not yet wired into an entrypoint, because there is no supervisor loop yet to
call them.

## Health (`src/health/`)

Four modules, each with its own doc comment as the primary source of truth —
this section is a map to them, not a replacement for reading them.

- **`heartbeat.ts`** — `createHeartbeatStore()`, an in-memory store of
  `subjectId -> last heartbeat`. **The supervisor contract**: call
  `recordHeartbeat(subjectId)` WHEN, AND ONLY WHEN, a cycle for that subject
  has genuinely completed — never on cycle start, never because no error was
  thrown, never because the process is merely still running. This is the
  fix for a real incident: a health endpoint that derived liveness from the
  *absence of an error callback* lied for fourteen hours while its loop was
  silently dead. `registerSubject(subjectId)` separately marks a subject as
  known (e.g. the roster says it should exist) without asserting it is
  healthy — this is what lets "tracked, never completed a cycle" and
  "never tracked at all" stay two different facts (see below).

- **`staleness.ts`** — `evaluateStaleness(lookup, now, thresholdMs)`, a
  **pure** function: no clock read, no filesystem, no I/O, no ambient state.
  Returns a `StalenessVerdict` discriminated union: `healthy`, `stale`, or
  `unknown`. `unknown` is reachable *only* when the store never tracked the
  subject at all — it is not merely nullable or a comment, it is a value the
  compiler forces every caller to exhaust, and there is no code path from an
  untracked lookup to a definite `stale` or `healthy`. This exists because of
  a second real incident: querying a registry about a subject outside its
  scope produced "no recent heartbeat," which a naive two-valued evaluator
  would faithfully — and wrongly — report as the same "stale" a real death
  produces. Default threshold is `DEFAULT_STALENESS_THRESHOLD_MS` = 90
  seconds; reasoning is in the module doc comment (three times an assumed
  ~30s cycle cadence — tolerate one slow cycle, not two — pending a real
  supervisor loop to measure an actual cadence against).
  Boundary rule: an age of exactly `thresholdMs` is `healthy`; staleness
  requires the age to *exceed* the threshold.

- **`alarm.ts`** — `startStalenessAlarm(options)` runs an **independent
  `setInterval`** that evaluates every tracked subject on its own schedule
  and logs at **ERROR** level (the documented floor for "loud" — it surfaces
  in the journal) when one is `stale`. It never fires for `unknown`: an
  alarm that cries wolf for everything it cannot see trains its operator to
  ignore it. The returned `stop()` is the *only* way to clear the timer —
  the timer id lives solely in a closure inside this module, never exposed
  to or reachable from the `HeartbeatStore` interface, so the loop being
  watched has no path back to silence its own alarm. `runAlarmTick` is the
  pure-schedule-free tick logic the unit tests drive directly;
  `scripts/verify-alarm.ts` is what actually proves the timer fires in a
  real process (see below — this is deliberately not something a unit test
  alone can prove).

- **`signal.ts`** — `buildHealthSnapshot` (pure) plus `writeHealthSignal`
  (atomic file write: temp file + `rename`, so a reader never observes a
  half-written signal) and `startHealthSignalWriter` (puts it on its own
  timer). **A file, not a network port, by design**: a host here can run
  more than one daemon under different Unix users, and a guessed port that
  answers is a *real* answer from the *wrong* daemon — the same failure as
  the registry incident above, made trivial to hit by a port. The written
  JSON states its own scope explicitly (`scope.statement`, plus `host` and
  `pid`) so a reader can tell "this signal never watched that subject" apart
  from "this signal watched it and it's stale" — a subject absent from
  `subjects` was never observed, full stop; it never appears as a
  fabricated `stale` entry.

### Proving the alarm actually fires

A unit test asserting a mock callback was called cannot prove a real timer
fires in a real process, or that a real untracked subject produces real
silence rather than a swallowed error — this repo already rejected one PR
for a capability that read as correct and could not actually run. So:

```sh
bun run scripts/verify-alarm.ts
# or, to control timing:
THRESHOLD_MS=500 ALARM_INTERVAL_MS=200 RUN_MS=2000 bun run scripts/verify-alarm.ts
```

What it does and what to expect, in both directions:

1. Records exactly one heartbeat for a tracked subject, then none again.
   **Expect**: real `ERROR`-level log lines naming it `STALE`, appearing on
   the alarm's own schedule partway through the run, with nobody polling.
2. Never registers or heartbeats a second subject at all. **Expect**: that
   subject's name never appears in any log line, and never appears as an
   entry in the health signal file (its path is printed at startup) — its
   absence *is* the correct, honest answer; a fabricated `stale` entry for
   it would be the registry-incident bug reproduced.
3. The process exits on its own once both timers are stopped — there is no
   `process.exit()` call anywhere in the script. A hang, or an exit before
   ever logging, would mean one of the two capabilities is fake.

## Intended layout

The entrypoint (`src/index.ts`) is kept deliberately small so that each of
the following can be added as a new module plus a couple of wired-in calls,
rather than a rewrite:

- **Roster** — the source of truth for which agents should exist and how to
  reach them, replacing the JQL-query-based discovery `butchr` uses.
- **Health** — see `src/health/` above. Built ahead of the supervisor loop
  that will call it; the seam is the `recordHeartbeat`/`registerSubject`
  contract documented there.
- **Supervisor loop** — reconciles the roster against reality: starts
  missing agents, detects drift, restores after a machine reboot, and is
  the thing that will actually call `recordHeartbeat` at the end of each
  completed cycle.

`src/log.ts` and `src/health/` are the shared infrastructure that already
exists ahead of the roster and supervisor loop — pure logic proven by real
unit tests in `test/unit/`, ready for the supervisor to call into once it
exists.

## Tooling

Bun as the runtime, package manager, and test runner (`bun test`), with
TypeScript in strict mode and `tsc --noEmit` as the typecheck gate. This
matches every other repo in `brooswit-factory` — none of them use a linter,
so this repo doesn't either; strictness comes from `tsconfig.json` instead
(`strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
`noImplicitOverride`).

## Commands

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile   # install deps
bun run typecheck               # tsc --noEmit
bun test                        # run the test suite
bun run build                   # bundle src/index.ts to dist/
bun run start                   # run the entrypoint directly, unbundled
bun run check                   # typecheck + test + build, in that order
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `typecheck`, `test`, and `build` on every
push, pull request, and manual dispatch.
